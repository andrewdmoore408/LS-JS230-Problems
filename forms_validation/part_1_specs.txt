The previous exercise is a first good step at validating user input. Let's enhance it a bit:

    The first and last names aren't validated properly: the user can use numbers in their name. With our current validation rules, the user can get away with using numbers as names. Don't let the user enter invalid characters in these fields.

Specifications

  Name validation:
    Use the pattern a-zA-Z'\s to validate user input for first and last names.

  Names event handling:
    Use the keypress event to prevent the user from entering a character that doesn't match the pattern.

  New inputs: credit card
    Add a credit card field to the form. The field should use 4 inputs, all with the same name attribute.

  Credit card validation:
    Each credit card input should have a maximum length of 4 characters.
    Each credit card input should only allow numeric digits.

  Credit card event handling:
    Use the keypress event to prevent the user from entering non-numeric characters in the credit card inputs.

  Phone validation: already done!
    The phone number input should only allow numeric digits.
