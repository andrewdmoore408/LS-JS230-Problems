This code is invoking event.stopPropagation rather than event.preventDefault. Because the IMG element is inside of the A element, it's still part of the link, so the default behavior for the browser to follow when it's clicked is to navigate to the linked URL.

Changing event.stopPropagation to event.preventDefault stops this default behavior (so the browser no longer loads the URL in the A tag's href attribute.
